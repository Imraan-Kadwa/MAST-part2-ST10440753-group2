Food Feod is a menu management app built using React Native that allows users to create, edit, and view menu items categorized by course. The app uses AsyncStorage to store menu items, ensuring they persist between sessions. Users can add new menu items by entering their name, description, course, and price. The app ensures all fields are filled and the price is a positive number. Users can view all added menu items, filter them by course, and see the average price for each course. Users can delete all menu items. The app has three main screens: Home, Edit Menu, and Menu. Users can switch between these screens using buttons in the footer. To add a new item, users can fill in the required fields and click Save. The menu screen displays hardcoded menu items with the option to filter by course. Users can delete all items from the "Edit Menu" screen by clicking the Delete All Menu Items button.
